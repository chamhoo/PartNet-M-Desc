    "part_description": "Two oval lenses, black frame, two curved temples. Lenses are centered, temples extend from sides.",
    "internal_interaction_description": "The lenses are securely held within the black frame, which provides structural support. The temples are hinged to the frame, allowing them to fold inward for compact storage. The hinges enable smooth movement, ensuring the temples can adjust to fit comfortably over the ears.",
    "external_interaction_description": "The sunglasses are worn on the face, with the lenses providing eye protection from sunlight. The temples rest over the ears, securing the glasses in place. They interact with the wearer's nose bridge for support, and can be easily removed or adjusted as needed."
