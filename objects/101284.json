    "part_description": "Two black lenses connected by a bridge, blue arms attached to each lens, curved for fitting over ears.",
    "internal_interaction_description": "The lenses are connected by a bridge that maintains the structure and alignment. The arms are hinged at the outer edges of the lenses, allowing them to fold inward for compact storage. The curvature of the arms ensures a secure fit on the wearer\u2019s ears, balancing the weight of the frame.",
    "external_interaction_description": "The sunglasses provide protection from sunlight by blocking UV rays, enhancing comfort and visibility for the wearer. The arms rest on the ears while the bridge sits on the nose, allowing for a stable fit. They can be easily worn and removed, compatible with various head sizes and shapes."
