The flushing lever on the tank triggers the release of water, which cleans the bowl. The seat provides a comfortable surface for use, and the lid can be closed to cover the bowl.",
    "external_interaction_description": "The toilet connects to plumbing for water supply and waste removal. It is used by people for sanitation, requiring manual operation of the flushing lever. Cleaning involves external wiping and internal scrubbing to maintain hygiene. It is typically installed in bathrooms, often alongside a sink and shower."
