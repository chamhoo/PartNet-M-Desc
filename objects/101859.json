    "base_description": "Black sunglasses with dark lenses.",
    "part_description": "Two dark lenses, black frame, and two black temples.",
    "internal_interaction_description": "The lenses are securely fitted within the black frame, providing stability. The temples are hinged to the frame, allowing them to fold inward for compact storage. The frame's curvature holds the lenses and temples in alignment, ensuring a comfortable fit on the face.",
    "external_interaction_description": "Designed to be worn on the face, resting on the ears and nose. The dark lenses reduce glare and protect eyes from sunlight. The temples grip the sides of the head, keeping the sunglasses in place during movement. Compatible with most facial shapes and sizes."
