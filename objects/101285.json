    "part_description": "Two blue rectangular lenses and white zigzag arms.",
    "internal_interaction_description": "The lenses are attached to the arms at the hinges, allowing them to fold. The zigzag design of the arms provides a unique style and potentially a grip function. Each arm connects to the side of a lens, maintaining the structure and usability of the glasses.",
    "external_interaction_description": "These glasses are worn on the face, with the arms resting on the ears for support. The lenses cover the eyes, primarily serving a decorative function. They can be used in novelty or costume settings, interacting with the wearer's appearance and potentially affecting visibility."
