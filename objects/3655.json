    "part_description": "Consists of a cylindrical base, conical body, and pump top. The cylindrical base is at the bottom, leading to a conical body that narrows upward. The pump top is positioned at the top center.",
    "internal_interaction_description": "The pump mechanism inside the top part interacts with the liquid inside the conical body. When pressed, the pump creates suction, drawing liquid up through a tube from the base to the nozzle, dispensing it externally.",
    "external_interaction_description": "The bottle is designed to be held and operated by hand. When the pump is pressed, it dispenses liquid onto a surface or into a user's hand. It can be refilled by unscrewing the pump top."
