    "internal_interaction_description": "The two blades are connected at a central pivot, allowing them to move in a scissor-like motion. When the handles are squeezed together, the blades close and cut through materials. The handles provide leverage, enhancing cutting efficiency.",
    "external_interaction_description": "The scissors interact with external materials by cutting through paper, fabric, or other thin materials when manually operated. The handles fit comfortably in a user's hand, providing control and precision during cutting tasks."
