    "internal_interaction_description": "The sliding panel moves horizontally along a track within the frame, allowing it to overlap with the stationary panel. This mechanism enables opening and closing, facilitated by the handle attached to the sliding panel.",
    "external_interaction_description": "The window allows light and air to pass through when open, providing ventilation and visibility. It can be opened or closed by a person using the handle, and it fits into a wall opening for installation."
