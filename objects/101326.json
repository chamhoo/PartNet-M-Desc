    "base_description": "Round, blue lenses with black frame sunglasses.",
    "part_description": "Two circular blue lenses, connected by a thin bridge, with black arms extending from each side, positioned symmetrically.",
    "internal_interaction_description": "The lenses are held in place by the circular frames, which are connected by a bridge at the center. The arms are hinged at the sides of the frames, allowing them to fold inward for compact storage. The structure ensures stability and alignment of lenses during wear.",
    "external_interaction_description": "The sunglasses are worn on the face, with the arms resting on the ears and the bridge sitting on the nose. They provide eye protection from sunlight and can be styled as a fashion accessory. Compatible with most head shapes, they can be easily carried and stored when not in use."
