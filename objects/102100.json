    "base_description": "Circular object with blue and orange components.",
    "part_description": "Features a central blue hub with eight blue blades, surrounded by a ring of orange ridges evenly spaced around the edge.",
    "internal_interaction_description": "The blue blades radiate outward from the central hub, providing structural support and possibly rotational movement. The orange ridges encircle the blades, likely offering stability and protection, while maintaining a consistent pattern for balanced interaction.",
    "external_interaction_description": "This object could rotate or spin, interacting with air or other elements for functions like ventilation or propulsion. Its design suggests it could be mounted or placed within a housing, affecting airflow or mechanical systems."
