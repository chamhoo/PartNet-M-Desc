    "base_description": "Small, cylindrical teal bottle with white cap.",
    "part_description": "The object consists of a teal cylindrical body and a white conical cap on top. The body is smooth and slightly tapered, and the cap is positioned centrally at the top, fitting snugly.",
    "internal_interaction_description": "The conical cap screws onto the cylindrical body, creating a secure seal to prevent spillage. The cap's internal threading aligns with the external threading on the bottle's neck, ensuring a tight fit. This interaction allows for easy opening and closing while maintaining the integrity of the contents.",
    "external_interaction_description": "The bottle is designed to be handheld, with its size and shape allowing for easy grip and portability. It can be used to dispense liquids by unscrewing the cap, making it suitable for applications like dispensing eye drops or other small amounts of liquid. The teal color may help in identifying its contents."
