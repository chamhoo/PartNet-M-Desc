    "base_description": "Gray cylindrical object with black base.",
    "part_description": "Consists of a tall gray cylinder and a smaller black base. The gray cylinder is smooth and uniform, while the black base is slightly tapered and rounded at the bottom.",
    "internal_interaction_description": "The gray cylinder securely fits onto the black base, likely through a friction fit or threading mechanism. This connection allows the cylinder to stand upright, with the base providing stability. The weight distribution is centered to maintain balance.",
    "external_interaction_description": "The object can be placed on flat surfaces, interacting with gravity to remain upright. It may interact with people as a tool or container, depending on its function. The smooth surface allows for easy handling and placement in various settings."
