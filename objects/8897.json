    "internal_interaction_description": "The door's handle is attached to the panel, allowing it to pivot for opening and closing. The horizontal lines add a visual texture, breaking the monotony of the flat surface.",
    "external_interaction_description": "The door interacts with its frame to open and close, providing access between spaces. It can be operated by turning the handle, allowing people to pass through or secure a room."
