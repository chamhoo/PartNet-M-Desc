    "base_description": "Gray, L-shaped, cylindrical object with two parts.",
    "part_description": "Consists of two cylindrical parts; one vertical, one angled.",
    "internal_interaction_description": "The two cylindrical parts intersect perpendicularly, forming an L-shape. The vertical part supports the angled part, providing stability and structure. The intersection is seamless, suggesting a single-piece construction.",
    "external_interaction_description": "The object can be positioned on flat surfaces, potentially used as a support or connector. Its L-shape allows it to fit into corners or serve as a bracket, interacting with other objects by providing support or alignment."
