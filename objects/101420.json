    "internal_interaction_description": "The blades rotate around a central axis, driven by a motor. The wire grille remains stationary, providing a protective barrier while allowing air to flow through as the blades spin, creating airflow.",
    "external_interaction_description": "The fan circulates air in its environment, cooling the surrounding area. It can be placed on a flat surface or mounted, interacting with its surroundings by directing airflow toward people or objects to provide ventilation."
