    "base_description": "Round, gray bottle with a cylindrical cap.",
    "part_description": "Consists of a spherical body and a cylindrical cap. The cap is positioned on top of the body, with the spherical part forming the main container.",
    "internal_interaction_description": "The cylindrical cap fits snugly onto the spherical body, likely serving as a closure to seal the contents within the bottle. The smooth transition between the cap and the body suggests a secure connection, preventing spillage or contamination.",
    "external_interaction_description": "The object can be held and operated by hand, with the cap being removed to access the contents. It might interact with other objects like shelves for storage or other bottles for grouping. Its design suggests use in contexts requiring liquid containment, like perfumes or sprays."
