    "base_description": "White sphere on dark brown stand.",
    "part_description": "The object consists of a large white sphere held by a dark brown circular ring and supported by a four-legged base. The ring encircles the sphere horizontally, and the base is positioned centrally beneath the sphere.",
    "internal_interaction_description": "The sphere is securely held within the circular ring, which is attached to the supporting base. The base provides stability, ensuring the sphere remains elevated and centered. The ring's snug fit prevents the sphere from moving laterally, while the base's legs distribute weight evenly.",
    "external_interaction_description": "The object can be placed on flat surfaces, interacting stably with tables or floors. It may be used for decorative purposes or as a functional item, depending on its intended design. The sphere's surface could potentially interact with light, reflecting or diffusing it."
