    "base_description": "Round, flat, dark gray disc with a thin edge.",
    "part_description": "Single circular part, flat surface, thin raised edge, uniform thickness.",
    "internal_interaction_description": "The flat surface and the raised edge are seamlessly integrated, providing structural integrity and maintaining a uniform shape. The edge encircles the flat surface, creating a defined boundary and enhancing the object's durability. The uniform thickness ensures balance and stability across the entire disc.",
    "external_interaction_description": "This disc can be used as a cover or lid, interacting with containers of matching size. It may be handled by people for placement or removal. Its flat surface allows it to rest on flat surfaces without rolling, providing a stable interface with other objects or surfaces."
