    "base_description": "Modern faucet set, silver, minimalist design.",
    "part_description": "Consists of a tall, curved spout and two flat handles. The spout is centrally positioned, with handles symmetrically placed on either side.",
    "internal_interaction_description": "The spout connects to plumbing for water flow, while the handles control water temperature and pressure. The handles likely rotate or lift to adjust flow, interacting mechanically with the internal valves.",
    "external_interaction_description": "The faucet set interacts with a sink, providing water for washing. Users operate the handles to control water flow and temperature, while the spout directs water into the sink basin."
