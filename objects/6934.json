    "part_description": "Consists of a circular face, hour and minute hands, and a thin frame. The clock face is plain and marked with simple lines for hours. The hands are slender and centrally positioned.",
    "internal_interaction_description": "The hour and minute hands rotate around the central axis, driven by an internal clock mechanism. The hands move in a synchronized manner to display the correct time, with the minute hand moving faster than the hour hand. The clock's mechanism is enclosed within the frame.",
    "external_interaction_description": "The clock is designed to be mounted on a wall, where it interacts with the environment by providing a visual representation of the time. It requires a battery or power source to operate. Users interact with it by reading the time or adjusting the settings as needed."
