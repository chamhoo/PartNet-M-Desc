    "part_description": "Two dark lenses, gold metal frame, nose pads, and temples. Lenses are teardrop-shaped, positioned symmetrically. Nose pads are beneath the bridge, with temples extending back.",

The nose pads provide support for comfortable wear, distributing the weight evenly. The temples are hinged to the frame, allowing them to fold inward for compact storage and adjust to fit the wearer's head.",
    "external_interaction_description": "These sunglasses shield the eyes from sunlight, reducing glare and enhancing visual comfort. They rest on the wearer's nose and ears, secured by the nose pads and temples. The design allows for easy pairing with various fashion styles, serving both functional and aesthetic purposes."
