    "base_description": "Silver faucet set with curved handles.",
    "part_description": "Includes one tall, curved spout and two separate handles. The spout is centrally positioned, with handles symmetrically placed on either side. Each handle is cylindrical with a curved lever.",
    "internal_interaction_description": "The handles control the flow of water through the spout. Turning the handles adjusts valves connected internally, allowing water to flow through the spout. The central spout channels water from both handles, combining hot and cold water based on the handle adjustments.",
    "external_interaction_description": "The faucet set interacts with plumbing to deliver water when handles are turned. Users rotate handles to adjust water temperature and pressure. The spout dispenses water into a sink or basin, and the setup is typically mounted on a countertop with plumbing connections beneath."
