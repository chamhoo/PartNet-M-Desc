    "base_description": "Rectangular, black fan with silver heatsink, compact size.",
    "part_description": "Includes a black fan with multiple blades, a silver rectangular heatsink, and several orange heat pipes on top. The fan is centrally mounted on the heatsink.",
    "internal_interaction_description": "The fan blades rotate to move air across the heatsink, enhancing thermal dissipation. The heat pipes conduct heat from the base to the fins, where it is dispersed by the airflow generated by the fan.",
    "external_interaction_description": "The object cools electronic components by dissipating heat. It is typically mounted on a CPU or similar device, interacting with surrounding air to reduce temperature, thereby preventing overheating and maintaining performance."
