    "base_description": "Square black fan with silver blades.",
    "part_description": "Contains a square frame, five silver blades, and a heat sink with fins. The blades are centrally positioned within the frame, and the heat sink is attached to the back.",
    "internal_interaction_description": "The blades rotate within the frame, driven by an internal motor, to push air through the heat sink. The heat sink's fins dissipate heat from the base, enhancing cooling efficiency.",
    "external_interaction_description": "The fan cools electronic components by expelling hot air and drawing in cooler air. It can be mounted onto a CPU or other hardware, interacting with the surrounding environment to maintain optimal temperatures."
