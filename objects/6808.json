    "part_description": "Circular frame with a central dark membrane, surrounded by a lighter grey rim. The frame is smooth and the membrane is slightly recessed. The rim encircles the membrane evenly.",
    "internal_interaction_description": "The central dark membrane vibrates within the circular frame, producing sound. The frame supports the membrane, allowing it to move freely. The rim provides structural integrity, ensuring the membrane's vibrations are effective and controlled.",
    "external_interaction_description": "The speaker emits sound waves into the surrounding environment, interacting with air and producing audible sound for listeners. It can be mounted on surfaces or integrated into systems, connecting to audio sources for playback. The design minimizes distortion and enhances sound clarity."
