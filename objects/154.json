    "base_description": "Silver faucet set with two handles.",
    "part_description": "The object includes a central curved spout and two side handles. The spout is tall and cylindrical, while the handles are short and horizontally aligned, positioned symmetrically on either side of the spout.",
    "internal_interaction_description": "The central spout and side handles are likely connected internally to control water flow. Turning the handles adjusts the water pressure and temperature, directing water through the spout. The handles operate independently but work together to mix hot and cold water.",
    "external_interaction_description": "The faucet set interacts with plumbing systems to deliver water. Users turn the handles to control water flow and temperature, making it suitable for sinks in bathrooms or kitchens. The spout directs water into a basin, while the handles provide user interface for operation."
