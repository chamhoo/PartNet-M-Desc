These hinges allow the arms to fold inward, making the sunglasses compact for storage. The frame provides structural support, ensuring the lenses remain aligned for optimal vision correction or sun protection.",
    "external_interaction_description": "The sunglasses shield the eyes from sunlight, reducing glare and UV exposure. They rest on the bridge of the nose and ears, held in place by the arms. Suitable for outdoor activities, they can be worn by individuals for both fashion and eye protection."
