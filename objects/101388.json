    "base_description": "Black ceiling fan with three blades.",
    "part_description": "Consists of a central motor housing, three evenly spaced blades, and a downrod connecting to the ceiling mount.",
    "internal_interaction_description": "The motor housing powers the rotation of the three blades, which are symmetrically attached around the central hub. The motor's speed and direction control the airflow generated by the blades, ensuring balanced and efficient operation.",
    "external_interaction_description": "The fan circulates air in a room, providing cooling and ventilation. It can be controlled by a switch or remote, allowing users to adjust speed and direction. The downrod maintains stability and distance from the ceiling, optimizing airflow."
