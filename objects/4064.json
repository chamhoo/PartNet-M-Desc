    "part_description": "The bottle has a cylindrical body with a narrow neck, a blue screw-on cap, and horizontal ridges for grip. It is transparent and medium-sized.",
    "internal_interaction_description": "The screw-on cap tightly seals the bottle, preventing liquid from escaping. The ridges provide structural integrity and improve grip. The narrow neck facilitates controlled pouring of the contents.",
    "external_interaction_description": "The bottle can be easily held and carried by a person due to its ergonomic design. It can be placed in cup holders or backpacks. The cap can be unscrewed to pour or drink the liquid inside, and the bottle can be recycled after use."
