    "part_description": "Consists of two cylindrical sections: a tall upper part and a smaller, tapered base. The upper part is elongated and uniform, while the base is shorter and narrows downward. Both parts are aligned vertically.",
    "internal_interaction_description": "The upper cylindrical section connects seamlessly to the smaller, tapered base, forming a continuous structure. The transition between the two parts is smooth, allowing for stability. The alignment ensures that the weight is distributed evenly from the top to the bottom.",
    "external_interaction_description": "The object can be placed upright on flat surfaces due to its stable base. Its elongated shape makes it suitable for holding or inserting into compatible openings. The green color may make it visible in various environments, aiding in easy identification and interaction."
