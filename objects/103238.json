    "base_description": "Large rectangular glass doors with white frames.",
    "part_description": "Four glass panels with white frames, arranged side by side. Each panel has a grid-like pattern with multiple smaller glass sections. The panels are set within a larger rectangular frame.",
    "internal_interaction_description": "The glass panels are secured within the white frames, which are connected to form a single cohesive unit. The grid pattern divides each panel into smaller sections, providing structural support and aesthetic design. The panels likely have hinges or sliders for movement within the frame.",
    "external_interaction_description": "The doors can be opened or closed to allow or restrict passage. They provide a view through the glass sections, allowing light to pass through. The handles facilitate manual operation, and the frames ensure stability and alignment with surrounding structures."
