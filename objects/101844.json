The angular arms extend from the frames, providing support and stability when worn. The zigzag design on the arms allows for a unique fit around the head, ensuring the glasses stay in position.",
    "external_interaction_description": "These glasses are worn over the eyes to view 3D content. The lenses filter light to create a stereoscopic effect, enhancing the viewing experience. The angular frames and arms fit comfortably on the nose and ears, interacting with the wearer's face to provide a secure fit."
