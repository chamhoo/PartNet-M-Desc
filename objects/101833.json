    "base_description": "White frame sunglasses with blue lenses.",
    "part_description": "Two blue lenses, white bridge, and white arms with cutouts. Lenses are semi-circular, bridge connects lenses, arms extend from lenses with rectangular cutouts.",
    "internal_interaction_description": "The lenses are secured within the white frame, providing structural integrity and stability. The bridge connects the two lenses, allowing for even weight distribution across the frame. The arms are attached to the outer edges of the lenses, hinged to fold inward for compact storage. The cutouts in the arms reduce weight.",
    "external_interaction_description": "The sunglasses are designed to be worn on the face, resting on the nose and ears. The blue lenses provide UV protection and reduce glare from sunlight. The white frame's lightweight design ensures comfort during extended wear, and the cutout arms offer a modern aesthetic when interacting with fashion styles."
