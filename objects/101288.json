    "part_description": "Two dark oval lenses, connected by a thin metal bridge, with curved metal arms extending from each lens, ending in slight hooks for ears.",
    "internal_interaction_description": "The lenses are secured within the metal frame, which provides structure and support. The bridge connects the lenses, maintaining their position. The arms hinge at the frame, allowing them to fold inward for compact storage. The hooked ends ensure they stay securely on the ears.",
    "external_interaction_description": "The sunglasses shield eyes from sunlight, reducing glare. They rest on the nose bridge and ears, providing comfort and stability. Compatible with most head shapes, they can be worn for outdoor activities, driving, or fashion. They can be stored in a case when not in use."
